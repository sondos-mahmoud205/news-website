# News Website

This is the readme file for the News Website project. Here you will find information about the project, its structure, and instructions on how to set it up and run it.

## Project Overview

The News Website is a web application that provides users with up-to-date news articles and information from various sources. It allows users to browse news by category, search for specific topics, and read detailed articles. The website is designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing.

## Features

- **News Categories**: Users can explore news articles by different categories such as politics, sports, technology, entertainment, and more.

- **Search**: Users can search for specific news articles or topics using the search functionality.

- **Article Details**: Users can view detailed information about a specific news article, including the title, author, publication date, and the article content itself.

## Technology Stack

The News Website is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- **Backend**: A server-side programming language such as Python, Node.js, or PHP, along with a web framework like Flask, Express.js, or Laravel.

- **Database**: A relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to store news articles and related information.

- **APIs**: Integration with news APIs to fetch and display news articles. Popular options include the Google News API, News API, or RSS feeds from trusted news sources.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the News Website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-website.git`.

2. Install the required dependencies for both frontend and backend. Refer to the documentation of your chosen frontend framework and backend language for specific instructions.

3. Obtain an API key from the chosen news API provider. This key is usually required to make API requests and fetch news articles.

4. Configure the backend to use the API key. This may involve creating a configuration file or environment variables to store the API key securely.

5. Set up the database by running the necessary database scripts or migrations. Refer to the documentation of your chosen database management system and backend framework for specific instructions.

6. Launch the frontend development server and backend server. This typically involves running commands such as `npm start` for the frontend and `npm run serve` for the backend.

7. Access the News Website by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate URL and port specified by your configuration).
